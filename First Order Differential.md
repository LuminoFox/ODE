## First Order Differential

Taking a first look at solving first order differential equations. 

Most first order differential will have a solution (ref to Cauchyâ€“Kovalevskaya theorem). However, we may be unable to write them.
Hence, we will first take a look at how to solve differentials of certain forms.

# Seperable Equations
These ODE are of the form **$N(y)dy = M(x)dx$**

To solve these differentials, we integrate both sides of the equation, like so, 
$\int N(y)dy = \int M(x) dx$
